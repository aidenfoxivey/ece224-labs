/*
 * "Hello World" example.
 *
 * This example prints 'Hello from Nios II' to the STDOUT stream. It runs on
 * the Nios II 'standard', 'full_featured', 'fast', and 'low_cost' example
 * designs. It runs with or without the MicroC/OS-II RTOS and requires a STDOUT
 * device in your system's hardware.
 * The memory footprint of this hosted application is ~69 kbytes by default
 * using the standard reference design.
 *
 * For a reduced footprint version of this template, and an explanation of how
 * to reduce the memory footprint for a given application, see the
 * "small_hello_world" template.

//There are four key elements required in code to use interrupts:
//1) An include statement,
//2) an ISR (which does basic processing and also clears the interrupt at the end of the ISR),
//3) A call to register the interrupt in the main c-code,
//4) Enabling/Disabling the interrupt by the “main” c-code inside the peripheral core (see core
//datasheet) at appropriate times for the application. This usually involves an Interrupt Mask.
